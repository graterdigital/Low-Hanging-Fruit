# Work orders: blushmedspact.com

Ahrefs Site Audit project 9704526 · crawl 2026-11-05 · health 98 · 21 active issue types → 7 work orders (1 decisions, 1 waiting on a skill not yet built) · generated 2026-11-09

Everything here needs a human: a template edit, a hosting ticket, a content call, or a client decision. Skills handle the rest and never show up on this list. Rows and counts refresh from each crawl; a row disappears (sheet: `cleared <date>`) when the crawl no longer shows the issue. Decisions go in the sheet's `decision_or_note` as `decision: …` and `--decisions` copies them into `clients/<slug>.yaml` → `rules.decisions`.

| # | item | goes to | tier | URLs | traffic | decider | what to do |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Pages hidden from Google (noindex/nofollow): confirm intent | indexation-review | decide | 4 | 0 | client | Confirm each hidden page is meant to be (legal pages, thank-you pages and press releases usually are); record the answer in rules.decisions. Ahrefs issues folded in: Noindex follow page, Noindex page. |
| 2 | Pages fix-meta routed to [] | [] | FLAG | 4 | 0 | agency | See the fix-meta report's 'Routed elsewhere' section. |
| 3 | Category page missing ItemList schema | schema-check | FLAG | 1 | 0 | agency | Ahrefs preference, not a Google feature. Optional: ItemList via wpseo_schema_graph filter. Usually leave. |
| 4 | Multiple title tags | manual | FLAG | 1 | 0 | agency | Two things print <title>: find the second (theme header, builder, plugin) once per site and remove it; usually one setting. |
| 5 | Product page missing Product schema | schema-check | FLAG | 1 | 0 | agency | Check whether these are quote-only products (no price = no Offer, schema adds nothing) or misclassified category pages. |
| 6 | Slow page | manual | FLAG | 1 | 0 | agency | Not page weight if HTML is small: run PageSpeed/WebPageTest on the top 3 by traffic and the host's APM; deep pagination = cold cache. Hosting or theme ticket. |
| 7 | 3XX redirect in sitemap | redirect-rules | APPROVE (skill pending) | 1 | 0 | agency | Skill `redirect-rules` is planned but not built; until then: fix the rule itself in the redirect plugin: collapse chains, 302→301, retarget loops and homepage dumps, chase 404s that still get impressions |

## Client briefs

One paragraph per client decision, ready to paste into an email. Agency decisions are in the table above.

**Pages hidden from Google (noindex/nofollow): confirm intent** (4 pages: /category/uncategorized/, /category/men/, /category/trending-treatments/, /category/botox/)

4 pages on blushmedspact.com are set so Google does not index them (or does not follow their links). That is normal for legal pages, thank-you pages and press releases, so we expect this is deliberate. Two options: (a) leave them hidden, which we recommend if they are not pages you want people to find in Google; (b) tell us which ones should be visible and we will switch them on. We will not change anything until you confirm.
